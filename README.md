# GDP & Population: 2024 Olympic Medals

This project explores the relationship between a country's population size and GDP per capita and its success in the 2024 Olympic Games. By analyzing these variables, we aim to understand how they influence the total number of medals won by different countries. The study also involves clustering countries based on their Olympic performance and socioeconomic context, providing insights into patterns and trends affecting their athletic achievements. Through this analysis, we seek to uncover the extent to which economic and demographic factors contribute to Olympic success.

In this project, we began with **data preprocessing** to clean and transform the dataset, ensuring it was ready for analysis. We then conducted a **correlation analysis** to explore the relationships between population, GDP per capita, and the total number of medals won, finding moderate positive correlations. Moving on to **regression analysis**, we built models to quantify how well these socioeconomic factors predict medal counts, revealing that neither population nor GDP per capita alone is a strong predictor. We performed **clustering and PCA analysis** to gain deeper insights, allowing us to group countries based on their Olympic performance and visualize these clusters effectively. These steps collectively led us to conclude that **while population and GDP per capita have some influence, other factors, such as sports infrastructure and government support, play significant roles in determining Olympic success**.

Below are examples of the graphs included in the report's analysis.
